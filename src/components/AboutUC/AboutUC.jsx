          <span>The Ukrainian Circle project</span> took place during June - August 2023. It
          was created for Ukrainians who were affected by the war to help them
          recover and restore their mental health, improve their well-being and
          empower them with mental self-help skills. The Ukrainian Circle
          project is based on 200 individual crisis sessions and 2 years of
          psychotherapeutic activities.
